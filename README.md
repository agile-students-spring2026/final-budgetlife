## Description

BudgetLife is a gamified budgeting application designed for users who want a fun, low-pressure way to manage their money. Inspired by city builder games such as Cities: Skylines and Clash of Clans, and budgeting tools like Rocket Money, the app reframes money management as city management.

Users act as the mayor of a digital city. Each budget category—such as food, housing, or health—is represented as a building within the city. How responsibly users spend their real-world money determines whether these buildings upgrade, stagnate, or decay. Monthly budget outcomes drive city progression, giving users a clear and engaging visual reflection of their financial behavior.

BudgetLife emphasizes non-predatory design, requires no paid currency, and avoids invasive data collection. Its goal is to encourage long-term financial mindfulness through playful, meaningful feedback rather than punishment or pressure.

## Project History & Contributing

BudgetLife began as an exploration into how game design principles can be applied to real-world behavioral change. The project evolved from a simple budgeting concept into a fully gamified city simulation focused on financial awareness, motivation, and accountability.The project builds on well-established budgeting app patterns while differentiating itself through interactive feedback and playful systems.
