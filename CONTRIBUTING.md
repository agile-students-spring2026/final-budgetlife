# Guide to Contributing

Delete the contents of this file and replace with the contents of a proper guide to contributing to this project, as described in the [project setup instructions](./instructions-0c-project-setup.md).

## Team Norms

### Resolving Conflict
1. The team will first try to address the issue with the problematic teammate immediately... a best effort will be made to get in touch with the problematic member, let them know that they are creating a problem for the rest, and resolve the issue internally.

2. If the situation is not resolved before the next standup meeting, the team agrees that...

    a) this will be reported to the project management (i.e. admins); 

    b) other teammates will take over the problematic teammates responsibilities; 

    c) a best effort will be made to keep the problematic teammate informed of what is going on in the project by posting regular standup notes and other updates to Discord.

    d) if the problematic teammate attempts to become more involved with the project at a later date, the team will make a best effort to help him/her do so.

    e) in no case will the team sit around and wait more than 2 standup meetings for a non-participating teammate to complete his/her tasks.

### Sprint Length
2 weeks

### Daily Standups
_TBD_

### Coding Standards
1. Designate a code editor and code linter all team members will use to standardize code formatting (Visual Studio Code).
2. Don't over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve. - Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the main/master branch of code.
3. Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
4. Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
5. Provide descriptive commit messages.
6. Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
7. Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
8. Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality.
